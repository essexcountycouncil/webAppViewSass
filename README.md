# webAppViewSass

The view part of the current(24/3/21) Essex website .NET build.
Generally this is from Stockport's site with some modifications as we have needed it.

Loosely based on https://github.com/smbc-digital/iag-webapp as of 1 || 2 years ago~

This should **not** be updated and just used as a reference for a _new_ Essex website.
If you _do_ need to update the site, we can make changes here and then send the raw files to Tech Services to update OR attempt to show them a PR of things we want changed.
